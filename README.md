# ft_services #9

My ninth project of the 42 school Codam. In this project you learn about Kubernetes and how to use it. You'll need to setup a multi-service cluster and every service has their own container. For this project to work you'll have to install minikube and docker or a virtual machine first.

Run the program with ```minikube start```. To access the dashboard use ```minikube dashboard```. Interact with your cluster by using ```kubectl``` commands.
